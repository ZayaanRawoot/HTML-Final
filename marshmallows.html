    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 c. powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3 (1/4-oz.) packages unflavored powdered gelatin</li>
        <li>1 c. cold water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 c. light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or extract </li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking pan with plastic wrap. Lightly grease with nonstick
            cooking
            spray and using a fine mesh sieve, generously dust the pan with powdered sugar. Set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/2 cup of the
            cold
            water; whisk to combine. Let it stand to "bloom" the gelatin (aka let it thicken), about 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and the remaining 1/2 cup water.
            Cook
            over
            medium-high, stirring often, until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring
            occasionally, until the sugar syrup registers 240°F (soft-ball stage) on a candy thermometer, about 10
            minutes.
            Remove from the heat.
        </li>

        <li>
            Immediately, turn the mixer to medium-low speed and carefully drizzle in the hot syrup. Once all of the
            syrup is
            combined, gradually increase the mixer speed to high speed, and beat until the mixture is very thick and
            fluffy,10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the vanilla.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pour the marshmallow mixture into the prepared pan and quickly smooth the top. Dust the top heavily with
            powdered sugar. Let stand, uncovered, at room temperature, overnight.
        </li>

        <li>
            Place powdered sugar in a medium bowl. Lift the plastic wrap to remove the marshmallow from the pan and
            transfer
            it to a cutting board; discard the plastic wrap. Using a large chef's knife, cut the marshmallow into
            about
            25
            even squares, dusting the knife blade with powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Working in
            batches,
            toss the cut marshmallows in the powdered sugar until no longer sticky; dust off the excess powdered
            sugar.
            Marshmallows can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.
        </li>

        <li>
            Optional: Place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between
            each,
            until the chocolate is almost smooth with some unmelted bits remaining. Remove the chocolate from the
            microwave.
            Stir until the residual heat fully melts the chocolate and the mixture is smooth (microwave an
            additional 15
            seconds, if needed).
        </li>

        <li>
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Working with one marshmallow at a time, dip halfway in the
            melted
            chocolate and sprinkle with chocolate jimmies, if desired. Place the marshmallow on the prepared baking
            sheet
            and repeat with the remaining marshmallows. Chill until the chocolate is hardened, about 20 minutes.
            Chocolate-coated marshmallows <strong>must be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to
                2
                days.</strong>
        </li>
