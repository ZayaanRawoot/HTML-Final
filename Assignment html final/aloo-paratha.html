    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potato</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coriander leaves</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon onion</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For the dough</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the filling:<br>
            To make delicious Aloo Parathas, boil the potatoes at least a <i>few hours</i> before you plan to make the
            parathas,
            mash
            them in a large bowl and cover and refrigerate. Take them out from the fridge and add chopped onions,
            coriander
            leaves, salt, garam masala powder and red chilli powder. Mix well so that no lumps remain. Ensure that
            you have
            finely chopped the onions or the filling will fall out.
        </li>

        <li>

            Knead a soft dough and roll a chapati and fill with the stuffing:<br>

            Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make
            small-medium balls
            of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre.
            Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be very careful to apply
            pressure
            evenly. It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will
            never
            be able to make perfect parathas. Seal the dough and round it with your fingers. Now, roll them with a
            rolling
            pin into round parathas. Apply the pressure very evenly and gently on all sides. Press very lightly so
            that the
            mixture does not come out.

        <li>
            Pan fry the Aloo Paratha:<br>
            Heat an iron tawa and roast the parathas, cooking them on both sides with a spoonful of olive oil. If
            you want
            to use less oil on the parathas, first roast them on both sides on low flame and when they are slightly
            crispy,
            apply olive oil with a kitchen brush on both sides. You must keep the flame low.

        </li>

        <li>

            Serve hot with curd, pickle and chutney:<br>
            Serve piping hot parathas with chilled yoghurt or pickle. You can also serve the aloo parathas with
            green
            chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy. Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka
            paratha. You
            can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with this paratha.
